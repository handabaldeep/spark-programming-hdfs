In this project I will be working with a dataset containing a collection of Emails exchanged by employees of the Enron corporation in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This dataset became a public record following a high-profile investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which resulted in several Enronâ€™s top executives being prosecuted for fraud, and the company itself going bankrupt (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal for more details).

The dataset is structured as a Hadoop Sequence File comprising a collection of binary objects each of which representing a single Email message.

Using the Spark programming in Python I will analyse basic properties of the network induced by the full Enron Email dataset.
